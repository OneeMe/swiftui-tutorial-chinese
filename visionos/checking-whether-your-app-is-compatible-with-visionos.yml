- 内容: 'visionOS runs compatible iPad and iPhone apps to provide continuous access to existing content right away. visionOS supports most of the same technologies as iOS, so many apps built to run on iPad or iPhone can run unmodified on visionOS devices. When a compatible app runs in visionOS, it retains the same appearance it had in iPadOS or iOS, and its content appears in a window in the person’s surroundings.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'If you have an app in the iOS App Store, try downloading it and running it on Apple Vision Pro. If you run into issues, use Xcode to identify and fix them. If you built your app using the iOS SDK, Xcode 15 and later automatically adds a Designed for iPad runtime destination to your project. Use this destination to run your app and test its compatibility in visionOS. You can test most of your app’s core functionality in Simulator, but some features are available only on a device.'

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'visionOS contains most of the same technologies as iPadOS and iOS, but there are some differences. In some cases, a feature you use in your app might not be available because of hardware differences or because of differences in how people use a visionOS device. As part of your testing, consider the impact of any missing features on your app’s overall experience. Whenever possible, work around missing features by disabling them or providing alternate ways to access the same content.'
