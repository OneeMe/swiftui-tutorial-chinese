  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'In addition to helping you compose scenes, Reality Composer Pro also gives you the ability to add and configure components — even custom components that you’ve written — to the entities in your scenes and also lets you create complex materials and effects using a node-based material editor called Shader Graph.'

- 内容: 'Launch Reality Composer Proin page link'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'When you create a visionOS project in Xcode, it also contains a default Reality Composer Pro project named RealityKitContent within the Packages folder, which is a Swift package. The RealityKitContent package can include images, 3D models, and other assets like audio and video files. The assets you add to your project go in the RealityKitContent.rkassets bundle, while your source code goes into its Sources directory. The package also contains a file called Package.realitycomposerpro, which is the actual Reality Composer Pro project.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'To launch Reality Composer Pro, double-click the Package.realitycomposerpro file in the Project navigator, or click the Open in Reality Composer Pro button. If your project doesn’t already have a Reality Composer Pro project, you can launch Reality Composer Pro directly by choosing Xcode > Open Developer Tool > Reality Composer Pro.'

- 内容: 'The Reality Composer Pro window has several sections. The top-half displays the active scene. If you have multiple scenes, the window shows a tab bar at the top with one tab for each open scene. A scene in Reality Composer Pro is an entity hierarchy stored in a .usda file.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'The left side of the top pane contains the hierarchy browser, which shows a tree representation of the entities in the active scene. You can toggle it using the top-left toolbar button to reveal errors and warnings. The middle pane is the 3D View, which shows a 3D representation of the active scene. The top-right is the inspector, which shows configurable values for the item selected in the 3D view, hierarchy view, or Shader Graph, depending on which has focus.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Tip'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'A Reality Composer Pro scene can represent an entire RealityKit scene, and you can have multiple scenes in your Reality Composer Pro project, each driving a different RealityView in the same app. A scene can also contain a collection of entities to use as a building block. For example, if you had an airplane model, you might build a scene for it that contains its 3D model, a particle effect to make smoke come out its engine, and audio entities or components that represent the various sounds a plane makes. Your app could then load those combined assets and use them together anywhere it needs.'

- 内容: 'Reality Composer Pro projects start with a single empty scene called Scene which is stored in a file called Scene.usda. You can create as many additional scenes as you need by choosing File > New > Scene. New scenes open as tabs along the top of the window, and they also appear in the Project Browser as .usda files.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'If you close a scene’s tab and need to re-open it, double-click on the scene’s .usda file in the Project Browser. If you no longer need a scene, delete its .usda file from the Project Browser or remove it from your project’s .rkassets bundle in Xcode.'

- 内容: 'Add assets to your projectin page link'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'In Reality Composer Pro, you design scenes by first importing assets into your project. Then add assets to scenes and move, rotate, and scale them. The Project Browser tab displays all of the asset files in your project. You can add new assets by dragging them to the Project Browser or by choosing File > Import and select the assets to add to your project. To add an asset from the Project Browser to the current scene, drag it to the 3D view in the center of the window, or to the hierarchy view in the top-left of the window.'

- 内容: 'Reality Composer Pro projects can contain assets not used in any scene. Such assets are still compiled into your app and can be loaded at runtime and take full advantage of the efficient loading process for .reality files.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Reality Composer Pro can represent many assets as entities, but it can’t represent all assets assets that way; for example:'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'USDZ models do become an entity or entity hierarchy when you add them to a scene.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Image files do not become an entity. Reality Composer Pro only uses image assets indirectly, such as being the source texture for materials you build in Shader Graph. If you drag assets that Reality Composer Pro can’t turn into an entity, nothing happens.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Add any 3D models, animations, sounds, and image files you need to your project. You can organize your assets into subfolders to make the Project Browser more manageable as your project grows in size.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Reality Composer Pro has a library of assets that you can use in your own apps. You can access the library by clicking the Add button (+) in the toolbar. Click the icon of the down-arrow inside a circle next to an asset to download the asset to Reality Composer Pro. When the download finishes, you can double-click or drag the asset into your project.'

- 内容: 'Reality Composer Pro treats your imported assets as read-only.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Changes you make to assets in a scene only affect that scene’s copy of the asset. The changes you make are stored in the scene’s .usda file, not in the original asset. That means you can work without fear of inadvertently changing other scenes. If you plan to make significant changes to an imported 3D model, such as by replacing its materials with dynamic Shader Graph materials, import the model as a.usdc file instead of as a .usdz file, and then separately import just the supporting assets you need to avoid Xcode compiling assets that you don’t need into your app.'

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Any configurable values from the entity’s components in the inspector on the right.'
  提示: ''

- 内容: 'You can use the manipulator to move, rotate, and scale the selected entity.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'To move the selected entity around the 3D scene, drag the small colored cone that corresponds to the axis you want to move it along. Alternatively, you can drag the entity itself to move it freely relative to your viewing angle.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'To rotate the selected entity, click on the manipulator’s rotation control, which looks like a circle, and drag in a circular motion.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Reality Composer Pro’s manipulator only shows one rotation control at a time.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'To rotate an entity on one of the other axes, click the cone corresponding to the axis you want to rotate. For example, if you want to rotate the entity on the X axis, tap the red cone to bring up the red rotation handle for that axis.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'To scale the selected entity uniformly, click the rotation circle and drag away from the entity origin to scale it up, or toward the entity origin to scale it down. Because it scales uniformly, it doesn’t matter which rotation handle Reality Composer Pro is showing.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Note'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'In the manipulator, Red indicates the X axis, Green indicates the Y axis, and Green indicates the Z axis.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Alternatively, you can make the same changes to the selected entity by typing new values into the transform component of the inspector. The transform component stores the position, rotation, and scale for an entity. The manipulator is just a visual way to change the values on this component.'

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Reality Composer Pro scenes can get quite complex and sometimes contain overlapping entities, which can be difficult to work with. To simplify a scene, you can deactivate entities to remove them from the 3D view. Deactivate entities by Control-clicking them and selecting Deactivate from the contextual menu. The entity still exists in your project and is shown in the hierarchy view, albeit grayed out and without any child entities. It won’t, however, appear in the 3D view. Xcode doesn’t compile deactivated entities into your app’s bundle, so it’s important to re-activate any entities your app needs before saving your project. To reactivate an entity, Control-click the entity in the hierarchy view and select Activate from the contextual menu.'

- 内容: 'Add components to entitiesin page link'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'RealityKit follows a design pattern called Entity-Component-System (ECS). In ECS, you store data on an entity using components and then implement entity behavior by writing systems that use the data from those components. You can add and configure components to entities in Reality Composer Pro, including both built-in components like ParticleEmitterComponent, and custom components that you write and place in the Sources folder of your Reality Composer Pro Swift package. You can also create new components in Reality Composer Pro and edit them in Xcode.'

- 内容: 'To add a component to an entity, select that entity in the hierarchy view or 3D view. At the bottom-right of the inspector window, click Add Component. A list of available components appears with New Component at the top. If you select the first item, Reality Composer Pro creates a new component class in the Sources folder, and optionally a new system class. It also adds the component to the selected entity. If you select any other item in the list, it adds that component to the selected entity if it doesn’t already have that component.'

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'To change the relationship between entities, or to create a relationship between two currently unrelated entities, use the hierarchy view and drag an entity onto the entity that you want it to be part of. If you want an entity to become a root entity, drag it to the Root transform at the top of the hierarchy view.'

- 内容: 'When you import a USDZ model into Reality Composer Pro, it creates a RealityKit material for every physically-based rendering (PBR) material the asset contains. Reality Composer Pro displays materials in the hierarchy view just like it displays entities, except it uses a paintbrush icon. Reality Composer Pro doesn’t display materials in the 3D view.'
  提示: ''

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'PBR materials are great at reproducing real-world surfaces. However, they can’t represent nonrealistic materials like cartoon shaders, and they can’t contain logic. This means that you can’t animate a PBR material or have it react to input from your app.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Reality Composer Pro offers a second type of material called a custom material. You can build and edit custom materials using the Shader Graph tab. Shader Graph provides a tremendous amount of control over materials and allows you to do things that would otherwise require writing Metal shaders. For more information on writing Metal shaders, see Metal.'
  提示: ''

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'The materials you build in the editor can affect both the look of an entity and its shape. If you build a node graph and connect it to the Custom Surface pin on the output node, that node graph controls the surface appearance of the model and roughly equates to writing Metal code in a fragment shader. If you build a node graph and connect it to the Custom Geometry Modifier output pin, those nodes control the shape of the entity, which equates to Metal code running in a vertex shader.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Nodes represent values and operations and serve the same purpose as either a variable or constant, or a function in Metal. If you need the sine of a value, for example, connect the value’s output node to the input pin of a Sin node. Add new nodes to the graph by double-clicking the background of the Shader Graph view or click the New Node button on the right side of the screen.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Important'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Some nodes, like Sin, are universal and can be used with either output pin. Other nodes are specific to either the Custom Surface or Geometry Modifier outputs. If a node name starts with Geometry Modifier, you can only connect it to the Geometry Modifier output pin. If the node’s name starts with “Surface”, you can only connect it to the Custom Surface output pin.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'To unlock the real power of Shader Graph, you need to be able to change values on the material from Swift code. Shader Graph allows you to do this by creating promoted inputs, which are parameters you can set and read from Swift to change your material at runtime. If you have a feature that you want to turn on and off, you might create a Boolean input parameter and have conditional logic based on its value. If you want to smoothly interpolate between two colors, you might create a Float input parameter and use it to control how to interpolate between the two colors. You can Control-click on a constant node and select Promote to turn it into a promoted input. You can also turn a promoted input back into a constant by Control-clicking it and selecting Demote.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'If you don’t have an existing constant to promote, you can create new promoted inputs using the inspector. The New Input button only shows up in the inspector when you select a material in the hierarchy view but have no nodes selected in the Shader Graph tab.'

- 内容: ''
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'To change the value of an input parameter from Swift code, use setParameter(name:value:), passing the name of the parameter and the new value. Note that parameter names are case sensitive, so your name string must exactly match what you called the parameter in Shader Graph.'

- 内容: 'Loading a Reality Composer Pro scene is nearly identical to loading a USDZ asset from your app bundle, except you have to specify the Reality Composer Pro package bundle instead. You typically do this in the make closure of a RealityView initializer. Reality Composer Pro packages define a global constant that points to its bundle, which is named after the project with “Bundle” appended to it. In the default Xcode visionOS template, the Reality Composer Pro project is called RealityKitContent, so the global bundle variable is called realityKitContentBundle:'
