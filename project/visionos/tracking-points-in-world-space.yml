- 内容: 'Use world anchors along with an ARKit session’s WorldTrackingProvider to track points of interest in the world over time, as a person moves while wearing the device, and across device usage sessions. For example, someone might place a 3D object in a specific position on their desk and expect it to come back the next time they use the device.'

- 内容: 'ARKit keeps track of a unique identifier for each world anchor your app creates and automatically places those anchors back in the space when the person returns to your app in the same location. A world tracking provider also provides the position of the device the person is wearing.'

- 内容: 'Use an ARKitSession configured for world tracking to start receiving updates on the world anchors your app places. The following shows updates to world anchors your app previously registered using the addAnchor(_:) method:'

- 内容: 'If a person repositions the current space — for example, by holding down the Digital Crown — world anchor updates begin updating their position relative to the new world origin. For example, a world anchor placed on a table still reports information about the table’s position, but those positions are relative to the updated world origin.'

  提示: ''

- 内容: 'You can create world anchors for any point of interest in your app’s world coordinate system once you’ve started a world tracking ARKit session. For example, you might track that a person placed an item at a particular offset from a desk in their space:'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Once you add a world anchor to your app’s tracking provider using the addAnchor(_:) method, the anchorUpdates sequence in the current session and future runs of your app provides updates to the current position of that new world anchor.'
  提示: ''

- 内容: 'Persist world anchors across sessions'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'The only information ARKit persists about the world anchors in your app is their UUID — a WorldAnchor instance’s id property — and pose in a particular space. It’s your app’s responsibility to persist additional information, such as the meaning of each anchor. For example, you might save local data about a custom 3D lamp model that a person placed on their desk.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'As a person moves from town-to-town or room-to-room, your app won’t receive all of the world anchor updates from each place someone used your app. Instead, the anchorUpdates sequence only provides world anchors for nearby objects.'
