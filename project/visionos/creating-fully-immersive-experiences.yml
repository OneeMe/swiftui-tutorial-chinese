- 内容: 'With a fully immersive experience, you’re responsible for everything that appears onscreen. The system hides passthrough video and displays the content you provide, showing the person’s hands only when they come into view. To achieve the best performance, use RealityKit or Metal to create and animate your content.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Typically, you combine a fully immersive experience with other types of experiences and provide transitions between them. When you display a window first and then offer controls to enter your immersive experience, you give people time to prepare for the transition. It also gives them the option to skip the experience if they prefer to use your app’s windows instead.'

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Give people control over when they enter or exit fully immersive experiences, and provide clear transitions to and from those experiences. Clear visual transitions make it easier to adjust to such a large change. Sudden transitions might be disorienting, unpleasant, or make the person think something went wrong.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'At launch time, display windows or other content that allows the person to see their surroundings. Add controls to that content to initiate the transition to the fully immersive experience, and provide a clear indication of what the controls do. Inside your experience, provide clear controls and instructions on how to exit the experience.'

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'When you start a fully immersive experience, visionOS defines a system boundary that extends 1.5 meters from the initial position of the person’s head. If their head moves outside of that zone, the system automatically stops the immersive experience and turns on the external video again. This feature is an assistant to help prevent someone from colliding with objects.'

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'To create a fully immersive experience, open an ImmersiveSpace and set its style to full. An immersive space is a type of SwiftUI scene that lets you place content anywhere in the person’s surroundings. Applying the full style to the scene tells the system to hide passthrough video and display only your app’s content.'
  提示: ''

- 内容: 'Declare spaces in the body property of your app object, or anywhere you manage SwiftUI scenes. The following example shows an app with a main window and a fully immersive space. At launch time, the app displays the window.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'To display an ImmersiveSpace, open it using the openImmersiveSpace action, which you obtain from the SwiftUI environment. This action runs asynchronously and uses the provided information to find and initialize your scene. The following example shows a button that opens the space with the solarSystem identifier:'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'An app can display only one space at a time, and it’s an error for you to try to open a space while another space is visible. To dismiss an open space, use the dismissImmersiveSpace action.'

- 内容: 'RealityKit works well when your content consists of primitive shapes or existing content in USD files. Organize the contents of your scene using RealityKit entities, and animate that content using components and systems. Use Reality Composer Pro to assemble your content visually, and to attach dynamic shaders, animations, audio, and other behaviors to your content. Display the contents of your RealityKit scene in a RealityView in your scene.'
  提示: ''

- 内容: 'To load a Reality Composer Pro scene at runtime, fetch the URL of your Reality Composer Pro package file, and load the root entity of your scene. The following example shows how to create the entity for a package located in the app’s bundle:'

  提示: ''

- 内容: 'Another option for creating fully immersive scenes is to draw everything yourself using Metal. When using Metal to draw your content, use the Compositor Services framework to place that content onscreen. Compositor Services provides the code you need to set up your Metal rendering engine and start drawing.'
