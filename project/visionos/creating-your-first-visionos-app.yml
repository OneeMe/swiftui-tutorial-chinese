- 内容: 'If you’re new to visionOS, start with a new Xcode project to learn about the platform features, and to familiarize yourself with visionOS content and techniques. When you build an app for visionOS, SwiftUI is an excellent choice because it gives you full access to visionOS features. Although you can also use UIKit to build portions of your app, you need to use SwiftUI for many features that are unique to the platform.'

- 内容: 'In any SwiftUI app, you place content onscreen using scenes. A scene contains the views and controls to display onscreen. Scenes also define the appearance of those views and controls when they appear onscreen. In visionOS, you can include both 2D and 3D views in the same scene, and you can present those views in a window or as part of the person’s surroundings.'

- 内容: 'Start with a new Xcode project and add features to familiarize yourself with visionOS content and techniques. Run your app in Simulator to verify your content looks like you expect, and run it on device to see your 3D content come to life.'
  提示: ''

- 内容: 'Organize your content around one or more scenes, which manage your app’s interface. Each scene contains the views and controls you want to display, and the scene type determines whether your content adopts a 2D or 3D appearance. SwiftUI adds 3D scene types specifically for visionOS, and also adds 3D elements and layout options for all scene types.'

- 内容: 'When creating a new visionOS app, you can configure your app’s initial scene types from the configuration dialog. To display primarily 2D content in your initial scene, choose a Window as your initial scene type. For primarily 3D content, choose a Volume. You can also add an immersive scene to place your content in the person’s surroundings.'

You can also use it to build and test custom RealityKit animations and behaviors for your content.'

- 内容: 'Many SwiftUI views handle interactions automatically — all you do is provide code to run when the interactions occur. You can also add SwiftUI gesture recognizers to a view to handle tap, long-press, drag, rotate, and zoom gestures. The system automatically maps the following types of input to your SwiftUI event-handling code:'

- 内容: 'Indirect input. The person’s eyes indicate the target of an interaction. To start the interaction, the person touches their thumb and forefinger together on one or both hands. Additional finger and hand movements define the gesture type.'

- 内容: 'Tap and drag the window bar below your app’s content to reposition the window in the environment. Move the pointer over the circle next to the window bar to reveal the window’s close button. Move the cursor to one of the window’s corners to turn the window bar into a resizing control.'
