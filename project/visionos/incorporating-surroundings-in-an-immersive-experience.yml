- 内容: 'Scene reconstruction helps bridge a gap between the rendered 3D content in your app and the person’s surroundings. Use scene reconstruction in ARKit to give your app an idea of the shape of the person’s surroundings and to bring your app experience into their world. Immersive experiences — those that use the mixed space style — are best positioned to incorporate this kind of contextual information: scene reconstruction is only available in spaces and isn’t as relevant for the full space style.'

- 内容: 'In addition to providing a 3D mesh of the shape of different nearby objects, ARKit gives a classification to each mesh face it detects. For example, it might classify a face of a mesh as being part of an appliance, a piece of furniture, or structural information about the room like the position of walls and floors.'

- 内容: 'You can make rendered 3D content more lifelike by having it appear to interact physically with objects in the person’s surroundings, like furniture and floors. RealityKit’s collision components and physics support make it possible to provide these interactions in your app. The generateStaticMesh(from:) method bridges between scene reconstruction and RealityKit’s physics simulation.'

- 内容: 'Be mindful of how much content you include in immersive scenes that use the mixed style. Content that fills a significant portion of the screen, even if that content is partially transparent, can prevent the person from seeing potential hazards in their surroundings. If you want to immerse the person in your content, configure your space with the full style. For more information, see Creating fully immersive experiences in your app.'

- 内容: 'Each object in the scene reconstruction mesh updates its transform information independently and requires a separate static mesh because ARKit subdivides its representation of the world into multiple, distinct sections.'
