- 内容: 'To maintain the sense of immersion on Apple Vision Pro, the system attempts to provide the device displays with up-to-date imagery at a constant rate and respond to interactions with minimum latency. Any visual choppiness or delay in responsiveness interferes with the spatial experience. Higher power consumption over extended periods of time, or extreme power consumption over shorter periods of time, can trigger thermal mitigations that also impact the quality of the experience. It’s important to minimize your app’s use of system resources to ensure your app performs well on the platform. Many of the same best practices and optimization procedures you use developing for other Apple platforms apply when developing for visionOS as well. For more information about optimizing your app on other platforms, see Improving your app’s performance.'

- 内容: 'You can profile using a real device or a simulator, but to get the most accurate and actionable information, use a real device. Software and hardware differences between a simulator on your Mac and a real device prevent you from relying on timing information. Simulated devices are useful for quick iteration and improving performance aspects that aren’t based on time.'

- 内容: 'Captures frame render times and lifespans for frames the visionOS render server generates. This instrument indicates when frames miss rendering deadlines and provides average CPU and GPU render rates.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Captures comprehensive timing information from the entire render pipeline including rendering, commits, animations, physics, and spatial systems. This instrument identifies potential bottlenecks in your app’s process or in the render server as a result of your app’s content and indicates areas of moderate and high system power usage that require optimization.'

- 内容: 'Inspect frame rendering performance'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'To maintain a smooth visual experience, the system tries to render new frames for the Apple Vision Pro at 90 frames per second (FPS). The system renders at other frame rates depending on the content it displays and the current surroundings. Each frame has a deadline for rendering based on the target frame rate. Not meeting these deadlines results in dropped frames. This creates a poor spatial experience overall. People tend to notice it in the visual performance of Persona and SharePlay experiences, video playback, and scrolling. The RealityKit Frames instrument displays the time spent rendering each frame in the Frames section of its timeline:'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'When you zoom out, you can identify areas with a high number of frame drops or with frames running close to the rendering deadline. The timeline uses green to identify frames that complete rendering before the deadline, orange for frames that complete rendering close to the deadline, and red for frames that don’t complete rendering that the renderer drops. Dropped frames contribute to a poor spatial experience, but frames that complete close to their rendering deadline indicate performance problems too. Hold the Option key and drag to zoom into a frame, or group of frames, to see their lifespan broken down in stages:'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'This provides you with insight into which portion of the rendering pipeline to investigate further. This timeline also includes sections that visualize the Average CPU Frame Time and Average GPU Frame Time to indicate the type of processing that computes the frames. A region of the timeline without a frame block indicates a period of time without changes to a person’s surroundings or app updates. The render server avoids computing new frames to send to the compositor during these periods which helps optimize power use.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Monitor system power usage'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'When thermal levels rise to levels that trigger thermal mitigations in the system, performance degrades and negatively impacts the responsiveness of your app. Optimize for power to avoid this negative impact. The timeline for the RealityKit Metrics instrument includes a System Power Impact section to identify areas of high power usage in your app:'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'If the timeline displays green, the tool considers your app’s impact on system power low enough to sustain. Regions that display orange or red indicate the system power usage could cause thermal levels to rise and trigger thermal mitigations. This decreases the availability of system resources, which can cause visual interruptions and responsiveness issues.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Note'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'If the render server can’t maintain the target frame rate of 90 FPS due to thermal pressure, it might reduce its frame rate in half. When this occurs, all frames in the frames track show up as missing their rendering deadlines. Other factors can cause reduced frame rate, including the complexity and frequency of the content the system is processing. Use the Thermal State instrument to determine if thermal conditions are causing the rate limiting or if it’s due to other factors.'

- 内容: 'Identify bottlenecks'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'The Bottlenecks section of the timeline for the RealityKit Metrics instrument contains markers that indicate high overhead in your app or the render server that contribute to dropped frames and high system power use. When you encounter either of these issues, check if the timeline identifies bottlenecks you can address. Double-click on any of the markers to display more information in the detail area at the bottom of the instruments window. If the detail area is hidden, choose View > Detail Area > Show Detail Area to reveal it. The render server encounters bottlenecks in either the CPU or GPU. The instrument categorizes bottlenecks by their severity and type.'
  提示: ''

Click the expansion arrow for the RealityKit Metrics instrument timeline to reveal graphs specific to each major category of work. Use the metrics associated with these graphs to determine which RealityKit feature has the biggest impact on high CPU frame times in the app process or in the render server.

It processes information in real time about your position, surroundings, and the current location of audio sources to generate an immersive audio experience. If you include too many concurrent audio sources that require the system to adapt audio sources to their location within a large space, the increased demand on system resources can lead to delays in the audio output.'

Initializing several audio players at the same time causes a high overhead that affects other aspects of the system, such as rendering performance. Consider the other tasks the system completes during these allocations and space them out over time. For more information, see Create a great spatial playback experience.'
