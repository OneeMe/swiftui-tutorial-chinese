- 内容: 'Use ARKit’s support for tracking 2D images to place 3D content in a space. ARKit provides updates to the image’s location as it moves relative to the person. If you supply one or more reference images in your app’s asset catalog, people can use a real-world copy of that image to place virtual 3D content in your app. For example, if you design a pack of custom playing cards and provide those assets to people in the form of a real-world deck of playing cards, they can place unique content per card in a fully immersive experience.'
