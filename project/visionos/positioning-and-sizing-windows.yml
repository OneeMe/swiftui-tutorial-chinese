- 内容: 'visionOS and macOS enable people to move and resize windows. In some cases, your app can use scene modifiers to influence a window’s initial geometry on these platforms, as well as to specify the strategy that the system employs to place minimum and maximum size limitations on a window. This kind of configuration affects both windows and volumes, which are windows with the volumetric window style.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Your ability to configure window size and position is subject to the following constraints:'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'The system might be unable to fulfill your request. For example, if you specify a default size that’s outside the range of the window’s resizability, the system clamps the affected dimension to keep it in range.'
  提示: ''

- 内容: 'Although you can change the window’s content, you can’t directly manipulate window position or size after the window appears. This ensures that people have full control over their workspace.'

- 内容: 'Specify initial window positionin page link'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'In macOS, the first time your app opens a window from a particular scene declaration, the system places the window at the center of the screen by default. For scene types that support multiple simultaneous windows, the system offsets each additional window by a small amount to avoid fully obscuring existing windows.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'You can override the default placement of the first window by applying the defaultPosition(_:) scene modifier to indicate where to place the window relative to the screen bounds. For example, you can request that the system place a new window in the bottom trailing corner of the screen:'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'The system aligns the point in the window that corresponds to the specified UnitPoint with the point in the screen that corresponds to the same unit point. You can use a built-in unit point, like bottomTrailing in the above example, or define a custom one.'
  提示: ''

- 内容: 'In visionOS, the system places new windows directly in front of people, where they happen to be gazing at the moment the window opens. This helps to ensure that people become aware of newly opened windows.'

- 内容: 'You can indicate a default initial size for a new window that the system creates from a Scene declaration by applying one of the default size scene modifiers, like defaultSize(width:height:). For example, you can request that new windows that a WindowGroup generates occupy 600 points in the x-dimension and 400 points in the y-dimension:'

- 内容: 'Both macOS and visionOS provide interface controls that enable people to resize windows, within certain limits. For example, people can use the control that appears when they look at the corner of a visionOS window to resize a window on that platform.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'You can specify how the system limits window resizability. The default resizability for all scenes is automatic. With that strategy, Settings windows use the contentSize strategy, where both the minimum and maximum window size match the respective minimum and maximum sizes of the content that the window contains. Other scene types use contentMinSize by default, which retains the minimum size restriction, but doesn’t limit the maximium size.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'You can specify one of these resizability strategies explicitly by adding the windowResizability(_:) scene modifier to a scene. For example, people can resize windows from the following window group to between 100 and 400 points in both dimensions because the frame modifier imposes those bounds on the content view:'

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'When you create a volume, which is a window with the volumetric style, you can specify the volume’s size using one of the three-dimensional default size modifiers, like defaultSize(width:height:depth:in:). The following code creates a volume that’s one meter on a side:'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'The volume maintains this size for its entire lifetime. People can’t change the size of a volume at runtime.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Although you can specify a volume’s size in points, it’s typically better to use physical units, like the above code which specifies a size in meters. This is because the system renders a volume with fixed scaling rather than dynamic scaling, unlike a regular window, which means the volume appears more like a physical object than a user interface. For information about the different kinds of scaling, see Spatial layout.'
