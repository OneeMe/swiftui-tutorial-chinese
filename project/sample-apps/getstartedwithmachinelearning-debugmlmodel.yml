- 内容: 'Your model only affects this app, but what if you were implementing this app on every iPhone around the world? Unfair bias due to overfitting is a serious problem in systems meant for use by everyone. It’s important to think about how to avoid bias when creating your own datasets and training your ML model.'

- 内容: 'Your model also might work well for you, but not as well for a friend. This can also be the result of overfitting. For instance, your ML model could better recognize one skin tone over another, causing some hand poses to be more accurately predicted than some in other skin tones. This is known as bias, because it favors one type of information over another.'
