- 内容: Your device has sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes which sense its
    motion and orientation. The Core Motion framework gives you access to data from
    these and other sensors.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The updateMotionData() method does the core work of the motion detector. It’s
    responsible for updating all published properties with current data from the sensors,
    as well as calling the code in onUpdate.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: You can use an overlay to put content directly on top of a view. The overlay
    occupies the same area as its parent view. In this overlay, a Spacer pushes a
    small Circle to the bottom of a VStack so it aligns with the base of the needle.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The .number style has modifiers much like those for SwiftUI views. For example,
    the .sign modifier lets you format the number so that it’s always preceded by
    a sign, even when the number is positive. You can also use the .precision modifier
    to specify exactly how many digits to use.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: A CMMotionManager is the object that you use to get motion data from the sensors
    in your iPad, such as the accelerometer. It gathers information from the sensors
    and translates their data into values you can understand.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Step 6
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The deviceMotion data may not be there in certain conditions. To see if the
    data exists, try to assign deviceMotion to a variable or constant using if let.
    If the motion data exists, it’s assigned to data and the code inside the braces
    runs. Otherwise, it skips the entire if statement.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'The LineGraph.swift file represents the main view of the seismometer. The initializer
    for LineGraph has four parameters: the data to display, the maximum amount of
    data in the graph, and the minimum and maximum values corresponding to its bottom
    and top edges.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The needle is just a rectangle with a .frame modifier to give it a narrow, tall
    shape. It also uses the .foregroundColor modifier to adopt the app’s accent color.
    Try changing the accent color of this sample to see how it affects the view.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Try commenting out the .clipped modifier to see what happens with the graph
    display.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: You use bindings to let other views control state properties. In this case,
    you’re telling the slider it can update the value of sensitivity as the user interacts
    with it.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: A unit point is useful for defining a point inside any view, regardless of its
    size. This one defines the midpoint of a view (width-wise) at its bottom. Regardless
    of the view’s size, the point is exactly at that location relative to the view’s
    width and height.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Step 8
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: This code creates a new timer and schedules it to run. The updateInterval property
    tells the timer how long to wait between updates, and repeats is set to true so
    the timer runs forever until you stop it. (If you pass false to repeats, the timer
    only runs once.) The block of code at the end of the line that reads { _ in is
    the start of a closure that contains the code run by the timer. The closure calls
    the updateMotionData() method.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Try out Seismometer by placing your iPad on a flat surface and then jostling
    it a bit. Or you can hold your iPad and move it up and down slowly.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: As you explore the seismometer, you’ll notice that the data can contain values
    outside the minimum and maximum range, but they aren’t displayed because they
    fall outside the view bounds.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The formatted() method operates on a number of basic types such as Date, Int,
    and Double, all of which are commonly represented as strings in an app. Because
    there are so many ways to format these strings, the formatted() method gives you
    ways to customize how they’re represented. For example, does a number represent
    a percentage, a simple value, or maybe a price?
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Seismometer
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The GraphSeismometer view displays a line graph of your device’s vibration.
    It uses the zAcceleration data from a MotionDetector instance to detect vibration,
    and translates that data into Y values in the graph; the X values represent time.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The amplification constant is useful for controlling the sensitivity of the
    display. Try changing its value to see how that affects the needle.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'The next three parameters control features of the slider. in: 0...1: specifies
    the slider’s range of values, from minimum to maximum. Use the minimumValueLabel
    and maximumValueLabel parameters to add labels at the left and right ends of the
    slider, respectively.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Use the .rotationEffect modifier to rotate the rectangle for the needle, and
    set the rotationAngle and needleAnchor properties to define the needle’s behavior.
    You pass in rotationAngle as the first argument, which interprets the motion data
    to calculate the correct needle angle.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Step 12
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: A CMDeviceMotion instance represents device motion, stored in data. The CMDeviceMotion
    class has quite a few properties for describing the input from the motion sensors.
    Use the attitude property to get the device’s tilt in three directions. You may
    be familiar with X, Y, and Z axes in 3D space, which relate to pitch, roll, and
    yaw, respectively.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The rotationAngle property returns the amount the needle rotates for a given
    sensor reading. The rotationEffect property expects an Angle instance, so you
    can create one using the zAcceleration property of the motion detector. The motion
    detector represents upward acceleration with a negative number, but you’re multiplying
    by -1 to make upward acceleration positive, and downward acceleration negative.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Without this overlay, you’d get a plain rectangle that rotates at its base.
    But to make things a little more polished, this overlay adds a small circle at
    the bottom.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Note
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The maxData property represents the maximum number of data points your graph
    shows. This is vital, because the seismometer updates 100 times per second, which
    produces a lot of data, and you don’t want to keep that around forever. When you
    accumulate enough data, you’ll start deleting the old ones.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: These properties have a @Published property wrapper, which means that any SwiftUI
    view that depends on their values automatically updates when the values change.
    You make a view dependent on a published property by using that value in the view’s
    code. The NeedleSeismometer and GraphSeismometer samples use these properties
    to update when the MotionDetector detects changes to the values of roll, pitch,
    and zAcceleration.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The argument to formatted() is a format style. The .number style gives you a
    string that describes this Double value as a simple number, as opposed to a percentage
    or a price.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Learn how to display the vibration of your device as an animated line graph.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The graphMaxValueMostSensitive property represents the maximum value the graph
    displays at its most sensitive, and graphMaxValueLeastSensitive represents the
    maximum value displayed at its least sensitive. Along with sensitivity, these
    properties control the graph’s display.

- 内容: Recognizing Gestures
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: To store a history of motion values to draw the line graph, assign the code
    inside the braces to the onUpdate property. This tells the motion detector to
    run that code whenever there’s new data to display. This code takes the latest
    motion data and adds it to the data array.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'You can use your iPad to detect vibrations using its built-in motion sensors.
    This sample shows how to display vibration information in two formats: a needle
    and a line graph.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The stop() method tells the CMMotionManager class to stop updating its values
    by calling stopDeviceMotionUpdates(), then it stops the timer by calling invalidate().
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: This method returns a string that describes the value of a Double with a fixed
    number of digits. You can pass in the number of integer digits and fraction digits
    you want, or leave those arguments out for the default values of 2.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The motionDetector property holds a MotionDetector instance. The motion detector
    senses changes in your device’s motion and provides that data for use in your
    code.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The data property stores the seismometer data you’ll graph in this view as an
    array of Double values. It includes a @State property wrapper because you want
    the line graph to update whenever the data changes.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Learn how the top-level view of the app passes motion data to its child views.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The NeedleSeismometer view displays a needle that moves as your device vibrates.
    It uses the zAcceleration data from a MotionDetector instance to detect vibration,
    and translates that data into left and right rotation of the needle.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Step 10
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The needleAnchor property defines the point of rotation for the needle as a
    UnitPoint. A unit point has x and y coordinates like a regular point, but their
    values only range between 0 and 1.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Double Extension
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: You can use the .onAppear modifier to perform actions when this view first appears.
    It’s the perfect place to start the motion detector. Use the .onDisappear modifier
    to stop the detector when the view isn’t visible.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The detector property holds the MotionDetector instance that’s shared throughout
    the app. The code annotates the property with @StateObject to indicate that SwiftUI
    keeps track of its updates. You can share state objects with other views, but
    this view is its owner.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The property has an @EnvironmentObject property wrapper because this view expects
    the app to put a motion detector in the environment for it to use.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Step 7
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The sensitivity property controls how sensitive the seismometer is to motion.
    Sensitivity affects the line graph by expanding it vertically. The higher the
    sensitivity, the larger the peaks and valleys will appear in the graph.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Step 5
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The modifier .aspectRatio gives it a square shape.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Choose an update interval that makes sense for your app. For example, you’ll
    want a short update interval for the seismometers in this project because the
    interface presents real-time data as you move your iPad around.

- 内容: Always use isDeviceMotionAvailable to verify that motion data is available before
    you try to access it.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: You can use an extension to create custom behaviors for existing types. Declaring
    extension Double means you’re adding new capabilities to the Double type. When
    you use a Double value, you can access anything defined in this extension.

- 内容: Step 16
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The SeismometerBrowser view displays the two options for seismometer display
    in a list. When you choose a display from the list, the app displays that view.
    The browser is a container for the other two views, so it also acts as the manager
    of the MotionDetector instance that gathers motion data from the device.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: This property holds a MotionDetector instance. The motion detector senses changes
    in your device’s motion and provides that data for you to use in your code.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: By default, rotation happens around the center of a view; however, you can use
    the needleAnchor property as the second argument so the needle rotates at its
    base.
  提示: ''

- 内容: You run the code in onUpdate just as you’d call any function, with a set of
    parentheses following its name.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: These five modifiers configure the line graph display. The .clipped modifier
    prevents the line from drawing outside its frame. You can use .background to set
    the background color. By using .accentColor the display can adapt to your app’s
    theme. Using opacity makes the color less bold.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Needle Seismometer
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: This property stores code that runs when the MotionDetector updates its motion
    data. If you want to execute custom actions when the motion data changes, you
    can put your own code into onUpdate in your instance of MotionDetector.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: To give other views access to the motion detector, you can use the .environmentObject
    modifier to add it to the app’s environment. Any child view of this view can use
    it by declaring a property of the same type and annotating it with @EnvironmentObject.
