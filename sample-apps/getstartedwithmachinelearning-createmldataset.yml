- 内容: Adding in these options before a training session creates four new images per
    option you use. For example, using the .rotate option generates four new images
    and applies a random rotation angle to the new images.

- 内容: 'Here, the trainer is augmenting the training data by adding these three options:
    .rotate, .translate, .horizontallyFlip. When you train a new ML model, the training
    session automatically uses these augmentations to improve the model’s predictions.'

- 内容: 'In Swift Playgrounds, you’ll be able to gather images of hand poses and label
    them to your game’s moves: Rock ✊, Paper ✋, and Scissors ✌️. These labeled images
    are the only examples that the machine’s “brain” has ever seen, so make sure they’re
    representative of what each hand pose looks like.'

- 内容: ML engineers often need to examine their datasets to ensure they always contain
    the best possible sources to return quality results. This process is called data
    cleaning, and it’s one of the most important steps in ML since it dramatically
    affects how your ML model performs.
  提示: ''

- 内容: Computers are great at detecting data patterns when given enough examples. To
    create a hand pose machine learning (ML) model, you’ll need several images of
    hands.

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Clean your dataset to ensure that the image contains a hand pose, that the pose
    isn’t too close to or far from the camera, that images aren’t mislabeled (like
    a Rock image accidentally labeled as Scissors), that the dataset doesn’t include
    any exact duplicate images, and that the dataset contains (roughly) equal amounts
    of images for each hand gesture.
